## What is this?

This is intended to be a free, open-source application used by cyber risk analysts to manage risk in a way that is easier than an excel sheet, yet still offers compatibility with excel. I've craved a way to do relational mapping between different entities, but it's been extremely frustrating using native excel. The idea is for the excel sheet to act as a CD or disk where you can input and eject the sheet intuitively. The application will create an excel template, and feed the data on that sheet into the application, thus having a performant application without the performance drawbacks of constantly polling an excel sheet. 

## When should I use this?

If you're tired of using excel to manage cyber risks in your environment, and want to take it to the next level without forking out thousands of dollars for a simple solution. 

## How to install

In the near future, this will be available to download directly from GitHub. 

## Architecture

This project is based on the Tauri project with TypeScript-flavored react on the frontend.
